<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<h3>My fascination with computers began at a very young age. I was drawn to the hum of the processor and the glow of the monitor, spending hours exploring every feature and function. This early curiosity sparked a lifelong passion for technology. I started learning to code by creating simple programs and soon I was building and upgrading my own computers. Pursuing a degree in Computer Science was a natural step, where I honed my skills through challenging coursework and hands-on projects. Each experience, from internships to collaborative projects, deepened my understanding and love for this field</h3>
<h3>Besides Computer Science, I am in love with Biology, I love to learn more and more about the nature and everything around us!</h3>
<h4>In spare time I love to learn to speak new language </h4>
<ul>
    <p>I, now actively speak:</p>
    <li> English</li>
    <li> German</li>
    <li> Spanish</li>
    <li>Turkish</li>
</ul>
<p>And I am now, learning Swiss German, as a one of the toughest German version.</p>
<h3>I also want to read books, and I am passionate about swimming, as I live in Ohrid I am swimming for very young age, also hiking and running.</h3>
